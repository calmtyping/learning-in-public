# Learning in Public

Projects, experiments, and ongoing learning logs.

## What this is

This is my public workspace. I use it to:

- Track the projects I'm working on
- Document challenges and courses (like OverTheWire, math, etc.)
- Capture notes as I learn new concepts and skills

It's not a polished portfolio – it's a record of progress.
