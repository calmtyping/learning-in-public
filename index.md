title: Learning in Public
---

Hi, I'm Miles (online I usually go by **calmtyping**).

This is my public workspace. I use it to keep track of what I'm building and learning, and to leave a visible trail of progress. It’s closer to a notebook than a polished portfolio.

## What you’ll find here

- Small projects and experiments  
- Logs for challenges, courses, and topics I’m studying  
- Notes from rabbit holes I go down when I get curious about something  

If you want more background on who I am and how I learn, check out [About Me](./about.md).

## What I’m into right now

- Python – small tools, scripts, and project ideas  
- Workflow automation, APIs, and CLI tools  
- Linux – getting more comfortable in the terminal  
- Math – tightening up foundations and notation  
- Networking and general “how systems fit together”  

I get curious about a lot of different topics, and it’s easy to lose track of what I’ve actually done. This site helps me keep that organized in one place I can point people to.
