# About Me

I'm Miles, online I go by **calmtyping**.

I'm a self-directed learner interested in programming, linux, math, and generally understanding how things work. This site is where I document what I'm building and what I'm learning, mostly for myself – but also so others can see my progress over time.

You can find me here:
