title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Miles — online I usually go by **calmtyping**.

I'm a self-directed learner from the US with a background in software engineering studies. I’m most comfortable in Python, with some experience in JavaScript and Java. I like workflow automation, APIs, CLI tools, Linux, math, networking and AI. — basically anything that helps me understand systems better or make them smoother to use.

## How I learn

When I pick up something new, I like to jump in and use it as fast as possible. I’ll start a small project or challenge, push forward until I hit a wall, then slow down and look for what I’m missing — docs, videos, articles, or questions to ask.

I’m big on “deep dive” sprints: picking a topic and letting myself go down the rabbit hole with videos, books, and tinkering until it feels natural. When I need to remember details (like commands or notation), I lean on flashcards and spaced repetition.

This site is where I leave a trail of those dives.

## How I like to work

My motivation comes mostly from wanting to get better at the things I’m doing. I’m happy to get feedback, especially when it’s concrete or backed by data, because it gives me something specific to improve on.

I don’t mind when tools, rules, or priorities change as long as I understand the reason behind it. I’ve done a variety of different tasks and roles, and I enjoy adapting as things evolve.

In general I like work where:

- I’m learning and leveling up a real skill  
- I can see the impact of what I build or contribute  
- there’s room to iterate based on feedback or real-world results

## What this site is

- A log of projects, experiments, and learning
- A way to see progress over time in one place
- A link I can share if someone wants to see what I’ve been up to

It’s intentionally not a hyper-polished portfolio. Some things will be rough or in progress, and that’s fine.

## Outside of code

Some other hobbies of mine:

- Weight lifting  
- Music  
- Games

You probably won’t see much workout or music content here, but I might keep a small list of games I enjoy.
