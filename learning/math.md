# Math Learning Log

I’m revisiting and expanding my math foundations, starting with core notation and concepts I want to be fluent with.

## Strategy

- Work through each section until the symbols feel natural.
- Use examples in my notes (not just memorizing meanings).
- Check items off once I can both **recognize** and **use** them in context.

## Notes

I’ll use this page to:

- Add quick examples for symbols as I practice  
- Write down any confusions and how I resolved them  
- Track my comfort level over time (by checking items off)
